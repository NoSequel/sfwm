# sfwm - simple fucking window manager
A simple window manager written in Rust using [x11rb](https://github.com/psychon/x11rb). 
* "Floating" mode
* Written in Rust
* No ICCCM
* No EWMH

## Installation
Not ready to be used. I'm still learning the Xorg protocol, I'm just following the x11rb examples and trying to make my own implementations for it. Not ready to be used until further notice.

## Thanks
